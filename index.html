<p style="font: 16px candara;">For starters, my name is Valentino Paletta. I was born in Holmesburg, Philadelphia on January 28th. I've lived in Philly for a good part of my life, however, I later moved to New Jersey in search for better living conditions. I mainly grew up in New Jersey in a town called Blackwood. Here, I got most of my education.</p>
<hr/>
<p style="font: bold 20px calibri;color:white;">Education</p>
<p style="font: 16px candara;">The first school I attended was James Brown Elementary. This was for about 2 years before we moved to New Jersey where I attended Thomas Jefferson and <a href="https://www.wtps.org/orchardvalley">Orchard Valley Middle School</a>. I started to take my future seriously and focus on my career once I entered High school (like many others). I attended <a href="https://www.wtps.org/wths">Washington Township High School</a> for 4 years before graduating as top 15% of the class. I now currently attend Montclair State University as a undergraduate freshman. I am studying Film and Television and hope to focus on a career in editing.</p><img src="Township.jpg" />
<p style="font: bold 20px calibri;color:white;">Work History</p>
<p style="font: 16px candara;">I acquired my first job at around 15. I took a job offer from a family member and worked primarily in customer service and packaging. I took it upon myself to run online customer service and package all the products we needed to deliver. Afterwards, I worked at the local trampoline park, <a href="https://www.urbanair.com/new-jersey-sicklerville/">Urban Air</a>. My efforts lasted about 3-4 months before I decided that I would go on to look for better work elsewhere. I am now currently scouting for potential work areas and focusing on possible internships over the summer.</p>
